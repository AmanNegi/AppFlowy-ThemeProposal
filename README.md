# Themes-Rewamp ðŸŽ¨

## Introduction

In AppFlowy, we offer users a selection of predefined themes to empower them with greater control over their application's appearance. However, it has come to our attention that these themes are not adequately optimized, leading to *usability issues*. This proposal aims to address this limitation by highlighting the suboptimal usability of themes and presenting recommendations to enhance their performance and user appeal.


## The problems

### 1. Contrast Issues â¬›â¬œ
In the following examples, we have utilized a contrast checker to demonstrate that the current color scheme employed is visually unappealing and compromises readability and visibility. It is recommended to make changes to the color selection in order to enhance these aspects and improve the overall user experience.


- **Dandelion Light**

In the image, it is evident that the combination of a white background and yellow card color is unfavorable. Additionally, the prominent yellow panel on the left contrasts excessively with other themes, resulting in a visually unappealing appearance. Consideration should be given to incorporating a darker shade or selecting a more suitable color to replace the white background. Furthermore, for a preferable light yellow shade, a slight adjustment towards a lighter background color for the cards is recommended. These modifications will contribute to an improved visual aesthetic and enhance the overall user experience.

- **Dandelion Dark**


Upon reviewing the image, it becomes apparent that the current combination of background and card color lacks coherence and visual appeal. It would be more advisable to employ similar shades with varying contrasts to achieve a more harmonious and aesthetically pleasing effect. By utilizing consistent color schemes throughout, the overall design will appear more cohesive and enhance the user experience.

- **Settings Panel**


In the section below, it is evident that an accent color has been employed as the background, accompanied by a blackish text color. It is crucial to acknowledge that the current contrast ratio is inadequate, resulting in difficulties when reading the text. This issue significantly impacts the readability and overall user experience. Therefore, it is recommended to address the contrast ratio by selecting alternative colors that provide a higher level of contrast. By doing so, the text will become more legible and easier to read, ultimately enhancing the user's experience in this section.

### 2. Callout Theming Issues ðŸ’¡
We offer users the ability to choose a color for the callout in our application. However, this customization option often leads to issues such as unreadable text and poor visibility. To rectify this problem, we propose implementing a solution where a specific text color is automatically assigned based on the chosen background color. By associating appropriate text colors with each background color, we can ensure improved readability and enhanced visibility for users. This approach will greatly enhance the overall user experience and ensure that callouts remain easily readable and visually appealing.

### 3. Startup Page Layout ðŸŒ 
The startup layout can benefit from improvements, particularly in the presentation of list tiles where the title and subtitle lack distinct visibility. Additionally, when opting to create a Folder, implementing a **page view** and utilizing the entire space by sliding the view would be advantageous. This approach allows for a larger text field and clearer instructions, enhancing the user experience. To further assist users in navigating, incorporating a back button for those who wish to browse the path would be beneficial. These proposed enhancements aim to *optimize the startup layout*, ensuring better readability, improved usability, and a seamless user journey within the application.

### 4. Other Isssues 
In addition to the aforementioned issues, we have identified some minor concerns related to the usability of components in dark mode. These issues primarily stem from suboptimal color choices that hinder the efficient utilization of dark mode. To address these concerns and improve the overall user experience, it is essential to optimize the color palette specifically tailored for dark mode. By carefully selecting and implementing colors that complement dark mode, we can enhance the usability of components and create a more visually pleasing and cohesive dark mode experience for users.

### 5. Font
In addition, we will also examine the inclusion of options to increase font size throughout the application, including separate settings for modifying the font size within **documents** and adjusting the font size within the **app panels**. These proposed features aim to provide users with greater flexibility and customization, ultimately improving their overall experience within the AppFlowy platform.
